# Dream Game Engine
Passion project focused on creating a game engine from scratch utilising OpenGL as the graphical API.

This project is mostly based on the Game Engine series by https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno.

Primary purpose of the project is to learn the architecture of game engines and learn how to implement various elements of a game engine such as:
- Rendering
- Scripting
- Memory systems
- ECS
- File I/O
- Physics

and more as the project evolves.
